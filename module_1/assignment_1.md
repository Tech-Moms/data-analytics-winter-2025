# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

Answer: Chat GPT can be used as a tutor. For example, I can give a prompt to the effect of teach me how to write a formula for a given purpose in excel. Or, how do I (insert need) in markdown. I can ask chat gpt questions similar to how I might google something, but should fact check information with at least two other sources. I should cite how I have used Chat GPT in my work. I can ask chat GPT to explain something in different terms, or even multiple different ways, or to communicate with me for a role play scenario that might help me think more critically about the use scase scenario related to my data to come up with insights and ideas on my own, based. I should be aware of privacy and sensitive information when I am communication with chat GPT.

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.
Answer: It partially worked following the directions. My natural inclination would have been to go to google next (hence step 3). It worked if there wasn't a filter, but I could not get it to work despite trying all the steps and asking for clarification even with the filter. This takes me back to my days of just entering the coding world in a class taught by a man with a bunch of men who seemed to get it. I would be redirected to the documentation (I can't remember if that's the right word right now) for answers, but the vocabulary was too foreign. When I finally figured something out I would have spent 2 hours that a 30 second analogy could have clarified in the beginning, and I felt like we needed real teachers who could relate or who know how to break down concepts teaching. This is why many capable people don't get into tech, becuase we make something seem hard that doesn't need to be hard (and that could apply to so many professions). The terminology in the explanation was too wordy (as I write a wordy response) and for someone new to the terminology took too much translation to synthesize, somewhat like a kid trying to read a book with too complex of vocabulary. I don't have a better explanation, yet, but graphics with the words could have helped.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPT’s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.
  - 
Answer: Google was more helpful. The first search hit was more succinct in its summary, although the tame steps (so the same challenge with filtering), easier to understand. I already know sorting, but truly didn't know how to overcome the filter issure. Treating this like a real scenario of me searching for how to do something for an end outcome v a learning purpose, I decided after skimming the google hits, my next step would be to select the desired cells and look for the sort button on the ribbon in excel instead of going through all those steps to see if that worked. Found the button and it worked. That being said, the first google link was organized more intuitively for me, with carrots/dropdowns to expand points that were relevant to the nuiance of my scenario. It helped with not giving too much information all at once, and finding and expanding the relevant information.

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this?
-  <img width="420" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-17 at 8 49 02 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8381d86-7939-4ef1-aeb2-3145ba040792" />
I chose to ask it something simple I know, because I wanted to focus on clarity of directions over figuring out how to do the task. The limitation is the basic prompt in Chat GPT doesn't yield graphic or expandable/collapsible sections, so it makes it more cumbersome to figure out what it's telling you if the vocabulary is unfamiliar. <img width="486" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-17 at 8 52 26 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c16f204e-ea7e-4333-ab88-e49c52e70799" />
I tried asking for clarity with visuals and simplified text. It created a visual that didn't match excel at all. For me at my experience level, google is more effective for learning specific tasks in excel, especially becuase it can take you straight to the microsoft tutorial or photo or video tutorials.

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information

- Answer:
- Chat GPT: idea generation, iterative processes, very basic commands (markdown commands, "what is the shortcut for copy (ctrl+V). Time sensitivity is relative to what is needed. If I needed a visual generated I'd go to Chat GPT over google. It's annoying to search free image resources on google and end up finding something you love that costs. To that same end, I've had to learn to adjust prompts to get what I want with image generation. Complex problems, chat gpt might be able to simplify explanations depending on the problem, help me find themes, bounce ideas, as long as I'm not sharing sensitive information. In terms of accuracy, for basic commands you'll know if they work. For facts, I wouldn't rely on Chat GPT but might use it to create structures, outlines, and again largely for idea generation. 
- Google: more factual (or easier to facts check across resources), less customized and iterative, specific and details instructions
If I want something factual, quickly, I would go to google over chatGPT. Complex problem solving google isn't a good resource for, but complex tutorials I still trust google mroe than chatGPT. Detailed visual instructions = google. Verifying information = google. 

Interestingly, after finishing all of the above work, I wanted to do a google and a Chat GPT search asking the question for this prompt. Seems the majority of the google hits all suggested chatGPT was better in many use cases (generalizing here, there were specific nuances and exceptions), but I also asked it as a general question v specific to the skills in this class. 

Here's what ChatGPT said: 
Both ChatGPT and Google are valuable tools, but they serve different purposes. Here's a guide on when to use each:

---

### **When to Use ChatGPT**
- **Detailed Explanations**: When you need in-depth, conversational responses, or help understanding complex topics.
  - Example: "Explain quantum physics in simple terms."
  
- **Creative Assistance**: For generating text, brainstorming ideas, or working on creative projects.
  - Example: "Write a poem about the ocean," or "Help me draft a business email."

- **Personalized Help**: To ask follow-up questions or dive deeper into a specific problem.
  - Example: "How can I improve this essay?" or "What are common issues in learning to code?"

- **Problem Solving**: When you need guidance on troubleshooting, solving math problems, or analyzing data.
  - Example: "How do I fix this Python error?"

- **Practice and Learning**: For educational purposes, like practicing languages or learning new concepts.
  - Example: "How do you conjugate verbs in Spanish?"

---

### **When to Use Google**
- **Quick Information**: When you need factual data or specific answers fast.
  - Example: "What is the capital of France?" or "What's the weather today?"

- **Up-to-Date News**: For current events, latest trends, or rapidly changing information.
  - Example: "Latest NBA scores" or "Election results 2025."

- **Broad Searches**: To explore a variety of sources or find websites and resources on a topic.
  - Example: "Best restaurants near me" or "Top tourist destinations in Europe."

- **Visual or Location-Based Searches**: When you need images, maps, or directions.
  - Example: "Show me a map of New York City," or "Images of modern art."

- **Official Information**: For authoritative details, such as company websites or government portals.
  - Example: "Renew passport online" or "IRS tax filing guidelines."

---

### **How They Complement Each Other**
- **Start with ChatGPT**: If you need help understanding, organizing ideas, or narrowing down what you’re looking for.
- **Switch to Google**: If ChatGPT indicates you need the latest or specific details (e.g., links to articles, location-based info, etc.).

Use ChatGPT for personalized and creative guidance, and Google for up-to-date, source-specific searches!

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.

- Answer: I feel like I'm still refining which approach is more effective for me. I've learned in any use of tech, part of what makes it successful is learning how to search most effectively. In relation to this course, I might use ChatGPT to troubleshoot, definitely for idea generation and iteration, editing after I've put the initial work in. (I teach my students the brain learns better when we try to think of an answer first, when me make the brain reach and stretch, even if we end up needed a hint or to be given the answer in the end. The process of trying makes it stick better than if it was just given to us.) Google will be more usueful for video tutorials and facts (although my google search told me that wasn't necessarily true, so I'll remain skeptical and open and inquisitive as I refine these skills.)
